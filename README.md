# Daily Planner App

## Overview

This Daily Planner App is designed to help users easily organize and schedule their day. 

When the user opens the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. When the user scrolls down, timeblocks for standard business hours are presented. Each timeblock is color-coded based on whether it is in the past, present, or future when viewed.

Users can enter an event by clicking on a timeblock. When the save button is clicked in that timeblock, the event is saved in local storage and will persist between refreshes of the page.
